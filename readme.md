# Machine Learning Algorithms Study code and notes
 --- 
This is a repository used to study codes that I have implemted from scratch in python. Variable names and algorithm implementation order follows from the book
"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning(Bishop)."

I will leave questions or concepts that I did not understand as an issue. Please feel free to leave questions or answers.
